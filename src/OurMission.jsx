          The idea of Neutrelle was born in response to the 2021 COP26 Climate
          Conference in our home city of Glasgow. We were faced with two
          seemingly unreconcilable drivers ; Our automotive passion and our
          desire to minimise our impact on the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          We began measuring the emissions from our vehicles and worked locally
          planting native tree species to balance them out. We decided to create
          an easy way for other automotive enthusiasts to make a positive impact
          on the planet through their passion and make sustainable motoring
          simpler. From this idea Neutrelle became what it is today.

          There are many benefits to the planet of the woodlands that we create,
          in addition to the carbon sequestration potential. One of these is the
          opportunity to enhance local biodiversity and secure ecosystems. Our
          projects are undertaken with this in mind and thus comprise a mix of
          species which allows biodiversity to flourish. Diverse woodlands have
          greater resilience

            Another key pillar of our mission is creating woodland spaces that
            people can enjoy. We want woodlands and green spaces to be
            accessible and benefit everyone. It has been shown that spending
            time in nature can improve mental health and well-being.

            Time in nature has even been prescribed to patients by the NHS to
            treat a plethora of ailments. We believe that no reforestation
            project can be a complete success if it does not also benefit
            people.

          Neutrelle was founded on the principle of sustainable motoring. We all
          know that to address the climate emergency we must phase out fossil
          fuels as quickly as possible. Neutrelle exists to provide a
          sustainable transition from fossil fuel use to carbon neutral
          sustainable motoring. Achieving this will only be possible when a
          drop-in fossil fuel alternative is readily available.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are committed to supporting the development of carbon neutral fuels
          to reach this transition point as soon as possible. The good news for
          automotive enthusiasts is that more talent is being deployed in this
          area than ever before. For example, in 2026 Formula 1 will use a
          drop-in carbon neutral fuel in itâ€™s Hybrid V6 Power units. The
          development to bring these fuels to market for consumer use is
          underway but must be accelerated to reach out climate goals.

        E fuels offer such a wonderful opportunity ... the carbon circle is
        completely neutral so the carbon utilised to produce that fuel is the
        same quantity as the carbon emitted from the internal combustion engine.
        It means that the engines do not add anything to the carbon dioxide in
        the atmosphere.

          For automotive enthusiasts motorsport is an expression of pure joy.
          Racing series around the world are making efforts to become more
          sustainable and we are committed to aiding this process. A lot of
          great work has been done carried out in this area however, there is
          still much waste which is very difficult to recycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to repurpose the hard to recycle waste in an effort to fully
          close the loop for motorsport. Some of our first projects have been
          working with Formula Student teams in the UK to promote sustainable
          practises in aspiring motorsport engineers and foster the next
          generation of talent.

          Transparency is at the heart of the Neutrelle mission. Alongside
          geotagging every tree we plant, in the event of selling your vehicle
          we make it possible to transfer the impact status of the vehicle to
          the new owner. This ensures the positive impact status of the vehicle
          can be carried with it for miles to come.
